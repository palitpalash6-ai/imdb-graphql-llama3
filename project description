AI-Powered GraphQL Movie API

This project is a full-stack application designed to manage a movie and actor database using **GraphQL** and **MongoDB Atlas**. It features a unique integration with a local Large Language Model (**Ollama**) to translate natural language into executable GraphQL commands.

Key Features

*   **Full CRUD Support:** Complete implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for movies and actors.
*   **AI-Driven Interface:** Uses `llama3.2:1b` to convert plain English (e.g., "Show all action movies") into precise GraphQL queries.
*   **Cloud Integration:** Backed by **MongoDB Atlas** for reliable, cloud-based document storage.
*   **Type-Safe API:** Built with **Ariadne** and **Python Flask** to ensure structured and validated data transfers.

Database Architecture

The application interacts with a MongoDB database named `imdb` containing two primary collections:

*   **Movies:** Stores `id`, `title`, `genres`, `director`, `actors`, `year`, `rating`, and `revenue`.
*   **Actors:** Stores `id` and `name` profiles.

Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python (Flask), Ariadne (GraphQL)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas & MongoDB Compass
- **AI/LLM:** Ollama (running llama3.2:1b)
- **Environment:** Dotenv for secure credential management

GraphQL Operations

Queries (Retrieval)
- getAllMovies`: Fetches the entire movie catalog.
- getMovieById(id)`: Retrieves a specific movie document.
- getAllActors`: Lists all performers in the database.

Mutations (C.U.D.)
- `createMovie` / `createActor`: Inserts new records.
- `updateMovie` / `updateActor`: Modifies existing entries.
- `deleteMovie` / `deleteActor`: Removes documents securely.

How to Run

1.  **Environment Setup:** Create a `.env` file with your `MONGODB_URI` and `DB_NAME=imdb`.
2.  **Start AI Engine:** Run `ollama serve` in your terminal.
3.  **Launch Server:** Execute `python app.py`.
4.  **Explore:** Access the GraphQL Playground at `http://127.0.0.1`.
